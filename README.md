# Coffeebird

Adds language support for Coffeebird in VSCode

Coffeebird is a DSL which compiles to Rainbird's RBLang. RBLang is an XML based language which is used to define concepts, relationships, and rules to solve complex decision making problems. Coffeebird replicates all of the features of RBLang without the visual noise of XML.
